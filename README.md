### Project Description<br>
SEE DESCRIPTION IN description.md<br><br>
### Test Instructions <br>
There are two methods to testin this project<br>

1. Automated testing
   1. Open two terminals, both in the assignment folder
   2. For terminal 1, enter the following command to START SERVER
            ./startServer.sh
   3. For terminal 2, enter the following command to test one client interact with server
      (This also will be included in the general tests below)
            ./startClient.sh
   4. Combined General tests: I have integrated some complex tests in test.java
      For general tests:<br>
      [1] press CTRL+C in terminal 1 to shut down server<br>
      [2] Restart server using command >> ./startServer.sh<br>
      [3] In terminal 2, run the command >> ./generalTests.sh<br>
      [4] This may take a while, please be patient<br>
      [5] See test summary in terminal<br>
2. Manual testing<br>
   1. First we need to compile everything, by using makefile<br>
            make<br>
   2. Use the command to release ports<br>
            kill -9 `lsof -t -i:4567`<br>
   3. Use the following command to start server<br>
            java AggregationServer<br>
   4. Use the following command to test GETClient<br>
            java -classpath . GETClient [http://127.0.0.1:4567](http://127.0.0.1:4567) ATOMClient/1/0<br>
       ** ATOMClient/1/0 can be replaced with any other client names<br>
   5. Use the following command to test ContentServer<br>
            java -classpath . ContentServer [http://127.0.0.1:4567](http://127.0.0.1:4567) ATOMClient1<br>
       ** ATOMClient1 can be replaced with ATOMClient2 ATOMClient3 ATOMClient4<br>
   6. Use the following command to run test.java, so to apply complex tests<br>
            java -classpath . test [http://127.0.0.1:4567](http://127.0.0.1:4567)<br>

* Expected output<br>
  
  1. if everything goes OK, you should see a 200 OK or 201 CREATED for outcomes<br>
  2. Also, for general tests using the test.java script, you should expect PASS for all four tests

### [IMPORTANT NOTE] Whenever you see a 'already in use' alert in terminal, you may use the following to release port: >> kill -9 `lsof -t -i:4567`
